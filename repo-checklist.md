### :tada: Choose a good name for your project

Naming is important. A good name will make your project attractive and can help people discover it.


### :dart: Provide metadata

GitHub allows to associate a description, URLs and tags to your project. You should make use of this and provide a short and catchy description and some tags that should be associated with your project. One of them should be `internet-computer`. Furthermore, you should attach the link to your landing page or project website.


### :blue_book: Create an informative README

The `README.md` is the public resume of your project. It should at least provide a high level overview and the goals of your project.

Some other useful content of your README could be:


#### :triangular_ruler: Provide an overview of the architecture and tech stack

A brief description and an architecture diagram helps visitors quickly understand the high-level architecutre of your project.

Some tools to create architecute diagrams:

- [Exildraw](https://excalidraw.com/) - Web editor to create beautiful diagrams in hand-written style.
- [Mermaid](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/) - Diagrams as code directly embeddable in GitHub Markdown.

#### :construction: Provide an update on your milestones and the progress

You can create a checklist of your features and milestones to give visitors a clear picture on the goal and the current status.
- [x] Read checklist
- [ ] Improve my repo


#### :bulb: Provide a description on how to use your project

How can people use or build/run your project. If you want to have others contributing to your project, you should also add instructions covering this.


#### :art: Add some visuals

People typically can get much more information on a blink if you provide a picture or a short video/gif that shows your project in action.

Some tools that might be helful for this:

- [Kap](https://getkap.co/) - Screen recording with GIF export (Mac only)
- [VHS](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs) - Tool to create GIFs of cli demos
- [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) - Tool to create buitiful code snippets

### :page_with_curl: Add a license 

If you don't add a license then people can't really use or learn from your project since they might fear legal repercussions. 

If you want to a permissive licence then [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) is a good choice, if you want to get more help in choosing a proper license, you can check out https://choosealicense.com/.

If you already have a repository and want to add a license, here's a [how to](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository).
